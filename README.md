# Ticket Text Classification
## ðŸ§¸Overview
This project is a text classification system that automatically categorizes customer complaints. It utilizes deep learning techniques to process and classify textual data efficiently.

## ðŸ§¸Dataset
The dataset is sourced from a project on DataCamp, with some code adapted from it. It includes customer complaints labeled for classification.

## ðŸ§¸Model Implementation
The model used is an LSTM-based neural network, consisting of:
- An embedding layer to convert words into vector representations
- An LSTM layer to capture sequential patterns in text
- A dense output layer with a sigmoid activation function for multi-class classification
